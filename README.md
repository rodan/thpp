## thpp

Thermal processing panel is viewer/analyzer of thermal images. It aims to be a rewrite of a project of mine from the 2000s with the same name hosted on sourceforge. The old project was Windows 95-XP oriented and it was written in Borland C++. This new one's target is mostly linux use and it attempts to also support radiometric jpeg images generated by a Flir camera.

currently supported functions:

image type | export to png | palette change | rescale | zoom
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- 
dtv | yes | yes | yes | yes
rJPG| yes | yes | - | yes


### Build requirements

the code depends on the >=media-libs/exiftool-12.42 package and the json-c headers and library.

compilation is simple, one only needs to
```
cd ./src
make
```

### Usage


### Testing

the code itself is static-scanned by [llvm's scan-build](https://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/), [cppcheck](http://cppcheck.net/). Dynamic memory allocation in the PC applications is checked with [valgrind](https://valgrind.org/).
